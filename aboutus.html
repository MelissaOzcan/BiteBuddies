            <p>
                At Bite Buddies, our mission is to provide a helping hand to students in making delicious and
                nutritious meals that suit their dietary restrictions and budget. We believe that everyone
                deserves access to tasty and affordable recipes.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Bite Buddies simplifies the meal planning process. Users can select their dietary preferences
                (vegan, vegetarian, kosher, pescetarian, or none) and their budget range. Our platform then
                suggests recipes tailored to these preferences, ensuring a diverse range of options for every
                user.

            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>
                Bite Buddies was created by a group of Stevens students who noticed that they were struggling 
                balancing their nutrition and their busy academics. They wanted an easy and quick way to find healthy 
                recipes that worked for them and knew could help others!
